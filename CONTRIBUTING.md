# Contributing Thoughts

This is for the community, so I want it driven by the community!

## PRs are greatly appreciated

If your PR is for an issue, please be sure to comment that you're working on it.

If your PR isn't for an issue, don't spend too much time on it, just in case it doesn't fit with the project's [limited] scope.
